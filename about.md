Currently living in the beautiful Vancouver, BC, where I recently finished my undergrad degree in
Computer Science.

I spent the last year playing in Capture the Flag competitions with the 
[newly founded team](https://ctftime.org/team/73723) out of UBC, where thanks to the other 
wonderful people in our group, I've learned **tons** about the world of computers and software
security in particular. Special thanks to [Robert Xiao](https://www.robertxiao.ca/) for all the work
he's put into teaching us.
