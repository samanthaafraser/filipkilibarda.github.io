Reversing
---------
- terminals, pseudo terminals
- fzf reads over stdin, write to stdout, controls terminal via fd 3
- looking at bash and how it handles fzf
- looking at fzf bash source code to see what it's doing
- compiling gdb with debug symbols (turn off optimization)
- how does readline work
    - reads char by char
    - writes back to terminal
    - fzf can't simply write into the terminal because readline wouldn't see it
- reversing readline?
